Musings on the 周易 (Zhou Changes)

Preface

Like many others who came of age in the 1960's, I became interested in a book called the I Ching (Yi Jing, 易經 == Changes Classic), also known as the 周易 (Zhou Changes).  Just as people who are seriously interested in the Christian Bible tend to learn Greek and Aramaic to get closer to the original sources, I have delved into Old Chinese.

What follows is my attempt at sense making.  In attempting to stand on the shoulders of giants, I am probably standing on some toes as well.  Please take the following in a sense of serious  playfulness.  It is sometimes fun to go astray.



Hexagram 1 - 乾 - Heaven's Pivot

乾   元亨利貞。
Heaven's pivot [斡].  Great success. Favorable determination.

COMMENTARY:

乾 is one of a group of cognate words with a sense of rotate/twirl.  An English example of cognate words meaning to twist:  wrist, wreath, wraith, wrench, wrap, wrestle.  乾 is usually translated as dry.  The image is twirling water vapor in the morning sun.

The Zhou Yi is an ancient text with a strong oral tradition.  It is theorized that some scribes/copyists were apparently writing as someone else spoke the text.  This is evident in some manuscripts where a character's phonetic was written, but not the radical.  There are some variant texts which use different words which sound alike (like see for sea).  This combined with the lack of context (what everybody knew in 1070 BCE, so did not have to be written, only referred to) and the shift in definitions over three thousand years makes the textual meaning of Zhou Yi difficult to determine.

In the case of 乾, I am reading the character as 斡, heaven's pivot.  For us, the sky/heaven revolves around the pole star.  But in 1070 BCE, the position of the still point around which heaven turns was somewhat shifted away from Polaris.  As a "part for whole" metaphor heaven's pivot implies the full circle of heaven.  

The handle of the big dipper (斗) turns around heaven's pivot. An ancient Chinese proverb states:  "When the handle of the dipper points east at nightfall it is spring throughout the land; when it points south, it is summer; when west, it is autumn, and when north, winter." [See Marshall's Mandate of Heaven, pg 65]

Constellations in the 斗宿 (the celestial Dipper Mansion) include 斗 (the Dipper itself),  天龠 (Heaven's Keyhole) and 建.  The MaWangDui (馬王堆 帛書 = Horse King Ruin  Silk Manuscript) version of the Zhou Yi has 建 in place of 乾.  Eduard Shaughnessy [see refs at end] translates 建 as key.  Karlgren gives (among other) definitions for 建 as linchpin and 斡 as wheel axle cap.  The derived meanings of 建 and 乾 are to establish (set up a linchpin/kingpin) and to revolve.  In hind sight the stellar connection and the theme of revolving round a stable point is pretty obvious.

The bulk of the 乾 hexagram lines deal with dragons.  The winter is dry, and dragons sleep in deep river pools.  In the spring, throw iron and other objects into these pools to waken the dragons.  An awakened dragon flies into the sky, causing lightning and thunder, hence rain, which fructifies the fields.  They are very fast, but sometimes one catches a glimpse of a tail, claw, or some scales, and in some cases one sees an entire dragon.  

As with other initially oral traditions, the mnemonic and ritual formula goes from low (lower lines) to high (higher lines).  This follows songs of the period in the 詩經 (Book of Odes).
